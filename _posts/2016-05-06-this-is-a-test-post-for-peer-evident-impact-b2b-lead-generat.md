This is a test post for Peer-Evident Impact B2B Lead Generation and Marketing Consulting's new site on the grid.

I'm writing this while riding in a taxi in Almaty, Kazakhstan. I've spent a great deal of time in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS - former Soviet Union) for nearly the last two decades. In addition to my day gig as an info-publisher, I've sold millions of dollars in products and services from one company to others. 

I've also run a consulting/coaching business helping people speak and write better, prepare for presentations, get jobs and gain university admissions and scholarships. I haven't quantified the value of those services precisely yet ). Now I have to because I've bought a house in the United States and will be relocating within a couple short months. So I've created this brand to provide lead generation B2B copy and strategy to companies in the West. I've started another one for clients elsewhere - ToJo Consulting & Training.

Our flagship product will be responsive and attractive landing pages (in that order of importance).
